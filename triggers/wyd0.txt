Left the last company, realised I should just apply myself to finding a way to pay rent and that it wouldn't be a problem if I just decided that was my focus, plus I just wanted to do more! So that's exactly what I've been doing, doing hard drive data recovery as a side gig, fixing electronics and teaching myself new things, working on a part time job doing data science for a newborn health lab, and working to make some microscope software that we can market independently of all that to hopefully get some separate passive income and start expanding our startup to clients for that.
