Hiya, I appreciate you reaching out! However, at the moment I'm pursuing a new position at my current company that's enabling me to work on applying Machine Learning and AI to Biotech, which is much more in line with what I'm currently hoping to pursue. Unless this opportunity allows working on AGI or my circumstances change in the future, I'm good for now!
